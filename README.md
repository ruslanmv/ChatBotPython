# ChatBotPython
Chatbot in python using NLTK, Speech Recognition, Google (text-to-speech)&amp; Scikit-learn


Our Bot uses an offline backend corpus as a knowledge base which user can change by merely tweaking the backend corpus by adding their personalization to answers from Bot. It is a simple command-line implementation for beginners, but to make it look interesting will be adding things like emotion detection, greeting function, and a color pallet to distinguish between questions and answers.
